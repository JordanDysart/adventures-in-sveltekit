### Purpose

This is just the first post that I saved in `/posts/`. I've set up some fonts and a general stylesheet so far. But, I'm going to walk away at some point. Before I do, I want a place to store posts so I can develop a basic site checklist.


My theory behind starting this project is that it will be good for my own development. This is the first time that I'm using SvelteKit, I've got all these other frameworks that I often rely on, but I don't really have a checklist for a basic site build. What are the essentials and how should I go about prioritizing them?... Let's find out.
